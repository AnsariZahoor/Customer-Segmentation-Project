# Customer-Segmentation-Project
End-to-End Machine Learning group project conduct by Packt &amp; TeamEpic.

## Problem Statement
RBLâ€™s marketing department collects various customer specific data of the credit card 
holders. They need a mechanism to segment the customer based on underlying 
characteristics and form market clusters which will be easy for them to target and provide 
product ideas to the management. Currently these tasks are performed manually by trusting 
the judgment of experts in the field. These can lead to human error, biased decision and 
other factors which may not be helpful to create a customer cluster that actually exist. They 
want to design a system that would automate this process and help the different 
stakeholders to make informed business decision.
